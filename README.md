# FreeCodeCamp - Build a Survey Form
## Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: [FCC: Survey Form](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

* [See Survey Form](https://stephenowen07.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Build-a-Survey-Form/index.html)
## Rules:
1. You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. 
2. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. 

## User Stories:

1. I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.
2. I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.
3, I can see a form with id="survey-form".
4. Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".
5. Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".
6. If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
7. Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".
8. If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
9. If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
10. For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".
12. For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
13. Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".
14. Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.
15. Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.
16. Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.
17. Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.
